<h2>Family Lineage</h2>
<p>Your main character is descended from a procedurally generated family tree node each time you play, so it makes hard to predict who exactly you'll play as.</p>
<p>But I can give you a rough idea of character classes:</p>
<h2>Classes</h2>
<p>The primary class that you'll run into is the hunter class, and everythingin the game will be structured around this rogue hunter. You might sometimes run into a princess, but unlike in some games you job isn't necessarily to rescue her or prevent from being executed.</p>
<p>Sometimes you'll also be descended from a royal member of that lineage, in which case you might play as the princess whom risks execution. I haven't entirely determined at this point whether allow one to rescue oneself is delaying in inevitable, as Roguelikes rely more on procedural generation than most games.</p>
<h2>Structure of sequels</h2>
<p>Because of this informal gameplay structure, the game will be periodically updated rather than having a normal sequel structure. Although eventually the idea is to have each update have a new MC whose entire backstore is built around death and rememberance in some way related to other protagonists.</p>
