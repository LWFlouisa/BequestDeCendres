<h3>Ehena</h3>

<h2>Structure of sequels</h2>
<p>Because of this informal gameplay structure, the game will be periodically updated rather than having a normal sequel structure. Although eventually the idea is to have each update have a new MC whose entire backstore is built around death and rememberance in some way related to other protagonists.</p>
